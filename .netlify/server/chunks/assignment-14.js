  return `<p>Moodboards are a useful tool for figuring out the look, feel, and even functionality of a website or app (they are used in other fields of design as well). They are essentially collages, and like collages they can take on many forms and purposes.</p>
<p>Our primary use case for a moodboard is to brainstorm, ideate, and acquire early design research deliverables.</p>
<h2>Objective: Create a moodboard that outlines UI and design asset ideas for a website or app</h2>
<p>Find examples of important user interface elements on websites out in the wild. Become familiar with elements that you will likely be creating throughout the semester, discover your sense of web design style.</p>
<p>You will also be putting together collections of design assets that you will be using throughout the semester. For this assignment, put together 2 variations of color palettes as well as 2 groupings of type faces. They should be distinct and express different identities, moods, and emotions.</p>

<p>Along with gathering design assets and finding examples of UI elements, your moodboard must also embody principles of design effectively. Moodboards are used for both communication (with team/clients) and discovery(of what you’re building).</p>
