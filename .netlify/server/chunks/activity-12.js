  return `<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal of this activity is to familiarize with basic programming concepts by using a visual building block style programming language called Scratch. This will be the only Scratch based activity in this program and will serve as a metaphor for learning Javascript.</p>
<p>You are welcome to build any type of project that Scratch allows. Common choices are:</p>
<ul><li>Interactivty story</li>
<li>Game</li>
<li>Animation</li>
<li>Music video</li></ul>
<p>The other half of the assignment is that you have to break down your app into pseudocode. You have the option of writing it out in pseudocode in a markdown file or creating a flowchart in a figjam file. You have equal points for creating your content as you do documenting it in pseudocode.</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>Create a project in scratch as noted above with the following requirements satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="project-requirements"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#project-requirements"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Project Requirements</h3>
<ul><li>Use at least 2 sprites (neither can be the Scratch cat)</li>
<li>At least 3 scripts (in total)</li>
<li>At least 1 conditional</li>
<li>At least 1 loop</li>
<li>At least 1 variable</li>
<li>Use at least 1 custom block that takes an input</li></ul>

<h3 id="code-quality"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#code-quality"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Code Quality</h3>
<ul><li>Features used work more or less as expected, use pop up messages when necessary</li>
<li>Scripts are broken down into smaller elements when possible</li>
<li>Pseudocode states what each block is doing clearly and concisely</li>
<li>It is clear (at a glance) of what scripts correspond to which pseudocode or flow chart</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Rubric</h2>
<h3 id="2-points-scratch-content"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#2-points-scratch-content"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>2 Points: Scratch Content</h3>
<ul><li>Required elements are present and logically used</li>
<li>Block settings and content have been changed to make sense with the content</li>
<li>Storyline is bigger than a simple hello world type example</li></ul>
<h3 id="2-points-scratch-code-quality"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#2-points-scratch-code-quality"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>2 Points: Scratch Code Quality</h3>
<ul><li>Scripts run when expected</li>
<li>If user input is required, itâ€™s clear when and how to do so</li>
<li>Correct blocks are chosen for the use case</li>
<li>Long scripts are broken up into custom blocks with descriptive names</li></ul>
<h3 id="2-points-pseudocode-logic"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#2-points-pseudocode-logic"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>2 Points: Pseudocode logic</h3>
<ul><li>pseudocode clearly and succiciently describes what each block is doing. with special attention to the I/O nature of the blocks</li>
<li>programming terminology used in class is reflected in pseudocode</li></ul>
<h3 id="2-points-pseudocode-clarity"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#2-points-pseudocode-clarity"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>2 Points: Pseudocode clarity</h3>
<ul><li>Pseudocode and/or flow charts are easy to read and identify</li>
<li>Enough context is given and script descriptions are clearly labelled</li></ul>
<hr>
<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>
<ul><li>Create an account with scratch and share a link to your project in the text submission box</li>
<li>Export the project file and attach it to your submission.</li>
<li>Also attach markdown files and/or image files of your board</li></ul>`;
