Moodboards are a useful tool for figuring out the look, feel, and even functionality of a website or app (they are used in other fields of design as well). They are essentially collages, and like collages they can take on many forms and purposes.

Our primary use case for a moodboard is to brainstorm, ideate, and acquire early design research deliverables.

<h2>Objective: Create a moodboard that outlines UI and design asset ideas for a website or app</h2>

Find examples of important user interface elements on websites out in the wild. Become familiar with elements that you will likely be creating throughout the semester, discover your sense of web design style.

You will also be putting together collections of design assets that you will be using throughout the semester. For this assignment, put together 2 variations of color palettes as well as 2 groupings of type faces. They should be distinct and express different identities, moods, and emotions.

### Applying Design Principles

Along with gathering design assets and finding examples of UI elements, your moodboard must also embody principles of design effectively. Moodboards are used for both communication (with team/clients) and discovery(of what you're building).

<h2>Content Requirements</h2>

- 2 distinct color palettes
  - each should have a: black (not #000000), white (not #ffffff), primary color, secondary color, (optional) tertiary
  - **include** a note about what the identity/mood/emotion(s) you're trying to evoke and your reasoning for it
- 2 distinct typeface sets
  - heading font, paragraph font, (optional) brand font
  - **include** a note about what the identity/mood/emotion(s) you're trying to evoke and your reasoning for it
- UI element collages
  - required: navigation bar (mobile and desktop), footer (mobile and desktop), header sections, 3 card layout
  - your choice: any elements found on [ui patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/)
  - **include** a note about what you liked about the design of the elements that you chosen (focus on the elements, not the content in the images)

### Resources

- **primary field of research** Search the web. look at sites that you like
- [UI Patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/): Examples and descriptions of specific ui elements
- [Material Design Manual](https://material.io/): Google's Material Design Guide contains examples of UI elements that you can look for
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Instructions

2. In a "Leading Idea" section, describe the types of sites or topics of sites that these moodboards are inspiration for. Also describe (in point form) the moods and tones that you're going for
3. Create a new section for each collection of content. label it appropriately
4. Add and organize the content in a way that represents principles of design while staying true to the mood that you're aiming for
5. Add notes (using sticky notes) to the board. Use a mix of positioning notes and adding comments to connect your motivations for your choices to your content.
6. When you feel like you've gotten it ready, Export images of the moodboard collections (each collection should be a separate image file)
