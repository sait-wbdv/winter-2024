In Figma, create a reusable card component and use it to render content for 3 different cards on a medium resolution mockup.

### Instructions

1. In figma, design a card component
2. Use placeholder content to fill the card (image, text, title)
3. Make sure your card follows principles of visual hierarchy
4. Apply the card 3 times on a separate frame (using Figma's component workflow)

- the frame should be desktop sized with a 12 column grid

5. Export the frame with 3 cards as a png
6. Submit the exported frame and a link to your design space

### Rubric

- 5 points for the component design
  - demonstrates the design principles learned in class
  - paths are labelled appropriately
  - follows conventions of card design
- 5 points for card usage
  - applied 3 times with different content in each card
  - applied in a desktop size frame using a 12 column grid

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

- Export an image of your base component (naming should be something like "original-card.png")

- Attach the two files to your submission
- **In the text box, add a link to your design space**
