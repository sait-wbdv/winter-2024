Using Figma, create a simple and web friendly svg logo and render it on a live html site hosted on Github Pages.

For this assignment, you will create a logo and deliver 2 variants of the logo (monochrome and multi-colored). These will be deployed to a web page as an img and inline svg respectively.

Your monochrome logo should be added to the page with an img tag
