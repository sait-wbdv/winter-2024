title: Mini Activity 1 - Program in Scratch
excerpt: Write a small program in the visual programming language Scratch.
points: 10
type: assignment
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of this activity is to familiarize with basic programming concepts by using a visual building block style programming language called Scratch. This will be the only Scratch based activity in this program and will serve as a metaphor for learning Javascript.

You are welcome to build any type of project that Scratch allows. Common choices are:

- Interactivty story
- Game
- Animation
- Music video

The other half of the assignment is that you have to break down your app into pseudocode. You have the option of writing it out in pseudocode in a markdown file or creating a flowchart in a figjam file. You have equal points for creating your content as you do documenting it in pseudocode.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Create a project in scratch as noted above with the following requirements satisfied.

### Project Requirements

- Use at least 2 sprites (neither can be the Scratch cat)
- At least 3 scripts (in total)
- At least 1 conditional
- At least 1 loop
- At least 1 variable
- Use at least 1 custom block that takes an input

#### **NOTE**: You should use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall to achieve these requirements successfully

### Code Quality

- Features used work more or less as expected, use pop up messages when necessary
- Scripts are broken down into smaller elements when possible
- Pseudocode states what each block is doing clearly and concisely
- It is clear (at a glance) of what scripts correspond to which pseudocode or flow chart

<h2>Rubric</h2>

### 2 Points: Scratch Content

- Required elements are present and logically used
- Block settings and content have been changed to make sense with the content
- Storyline is bigger than a simple hello world type example

### 2 Points: Scratch Code Quality

- Scripts run when expected
- If user input is required, it's clear when and how to do so
- Correct blocks are chosen for the use case
- Long scripts are broken up into custom blocks with descriptive names

### 2 Points: Pseudocode logic

- pseudocode clearly and succiciently describes what each block is doing. with special attention to the I/O nature of the blocks
- programming terminology used in class is reflected in pseudocode

### 2 Points: Pseudocode clarity

- Pseudocode and/or flow charts are easy to read and identify
- Enough context is given and script descriptions are clearly labelled

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

- Create an account with scratch and share a link to your project in the text submission box
- Export the project file and attach it to your submission.
- Also attach markdown files and/or image files of your board
