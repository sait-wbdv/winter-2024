title: Sprint Activity 1 - Program in Scratch
excerpt: Write a small program in the visual programming language Scratch.
points: 10
type: assignment
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

The goal of this activity is to familiarize with basic programming concepts by using a visual building block style programming language called Scratch. This will be the only Scratch based activity in this program and will serve as a metaphor for learning Javascript(JS).

To connect our work in scratch to how we will write JS, after creating your scratch project, you will also make a `script.js` file wherein your app can be transcribed as **pseudo code**. The pseudo code will simply be comments that map out the behaviour of your app - essentially declarative or objective focused instructions that outline code that needs to be written (you do not have to write any JS code for this assignment beyond comments).

You are welcome to build any type of project that Scratch allows. Common choices are:

- Interactivty story
- Game
- Animation
- Music video

<h2>Instructions</h2>

Create a project in scratch as noted above with the following requirements satisfied.

### Project Requirements

#### Scratch App

- Use at least 2 sprites (neither can be the Scratch cat)
- At least 3 scripts (in total)
- At least 1 conditional
- At least 1 loop
- At least 1 variable
- Use at least 1 custom block that takes an input

#### Pseudo Code

- captures everything that you made in scratch
- identifies variable creation (sprites and any other variables)
- describe the conditional logic and it's relevant outputs
- describe the loop iteration (how it counts) and what happens at each iteration
- describe the function(s) (custom blocks): what data they take in, and what is the output or desired behaviour

#### **NOTE**: You should use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall to achieve these requirements successfully

### Code Quality

- The code works and the output (game/animation/story) is reasonably coherent
- Use custom blocks with clear descriptive names when sequences get too long (ie: containing multiple steps and actions that aren't actually dependent on one another)
- JS comments are brief declarative statements
- JS comments use `//` at the beginning of each line (only single line comments for this assignment)
- JS comments are easy to understand
- JS comments are separated by whitespace

<h2>Rubric</h2>

### 5 points: Scratch Game

- Required elements are present and logically used
- Storyline is bigger than a simple hello world type example
- Scripts run when expected
- If user input is required, it's clear when and how to do so
- **Long scripts are broken up into custom blocks with descriptive names**

### 5 Points: JS Pseudo Code

- it's clear which scratch features are being outlined
- pseudo code uses declarative statements
- pseudo code is short and actionable
- pseudo code uses correct syntax
- whitespace is used to make pseudo code groupings clear

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

- Create an account with scratch and share a link to your project in the text submission box
- Export the project file, put it in a folder with your `script.js` file and zip them together
- Submit the zip folder
