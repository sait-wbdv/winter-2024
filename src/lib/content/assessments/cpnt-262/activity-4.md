<h2>Overview</h2>

This assignment is intended to help you develop your understanding about how js frameworks make data reactive and improve the developer's experience (DE).

You'll be creating a new Vue project that has just a single page `App.vue` as well as 2 components of your choosing. Then from there it's up to you to decide how you want to implement the following reactivity features:

- Data binding
  - v-bind attribute (at least 1)
  - double moustache variable rendering (at least 1)
- Conditional Example
  - v-if/else or v-show
- Props and Slots
  - at least 1 prop per component
  - use of 1 slot in 1 of the components
- Events
  - 2 usages of v-on for event handling
  - can be buttons but doesn't have to be
- reactivity
  - use of `ref()` or `reactive()`

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. create a new vue app and push it to github
2. pick use cases for the above listed language features
3. build your ideas between the App.vue file and the 2 components

Note: Styling and design are not important for this assignment. It's purely for practicing and demonstrating usage of vue directives.
