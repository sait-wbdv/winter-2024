title: Mini Activity 3 - Control Flows and Error Handling
excerpt: Organize data into objects and arrays. Use built in methods to access and manipulate their data.
points: 5
type: assignment
---

<h2>Overview</h2>

Here you will practice setting up both control flows and error handling. This assignment is meant to help you develop your algorithm skills for creating interactive web elements.

<h2>Instructions</h2>

1. Create a new github repo
2. Inside it there should be 3 files:
   - index.html
   - client.js
   - README.md
3. Set up your HTML file and import the `client.js` file in the head tag with a type="module" attribute added
4. Complete two of the following challenges and render their output to your html page
   - some are harder than others, they will all require that you combine the programming concepts and JS language features together to achieve the desired outcomes.
5. In the readme, document problems that you ran into while creating this and how you approached solving them

### Challenges

- Render a set of cards onto an html page by using javascript's template literals, an array of objects, and functions
- Reverse a String
- Find the longest word in a string
- Remove all falsey values from an array (must include `false`, and `0`)
- Title Case a sentence (all words get capitalized for their first letter)
- Render a set of objects based on the truthiness of one of the key-value pairs (visual & logical)
- Draw 2 shapes with characters (leet code like challenges)
  - ie: star pyramid, star hollow square

<h2>Rubric</h2>

This assignment is graded out of 10 points total but is worth 5% of your total grade

### 2 Points: 1st challenge

- solution works
- if solution doesn't work, partial marks for well documented pseudocode showing how you've tried to make it work and a hypothesis of why it's not working currently
- content is rendered to an html page
- solution is not a c/p from chatgpt or stack overflow
- use of syntax ideas learned in this course or from course materials

### 2 Points: 2nd challenge

- solution works
- if solution doesn't work, partial marks for well documented pseudocode showing how you've tried to make it work and a hypothesis of why it's not working currently
- content is rendered to an html page
- solution is not a c/p from chatgpt or stack overflow
- use of syntax ideas learned in this course or from course materials

### 2 Points: Code quality

- js is in strict mode
- modern syntax patterns used
- camelCase syntax in js
- whitespace used consistently and purposefully

### 2 Points: Notes, pseudocode, documentation

- code comments
- notes in the readme
- flow charts and/or pseudocode
- writing is clear and direct and relevant to the code it describes

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

1. As a comment in D2L: share links to make it easy for the instructor to quickly evaluate your work:
   - GH repos, Pages, Projects (Beta), etc.
   - Codepens, Figma, FigJam, etc.
2. Double check the Activity for specific instructions.
3. If applicable, include a README containing the following;
   - Activity name and author;
   - Attributions: Did anyone help you? Give credit to any classmates, articles, tutorials, etc that helped you complete this project.
   - Include self-assessments, observations, research, etc under the heading “Code Journal” in your README.
4. Zip project repo and submit it.
