<h2>How to Conduct a Usability Test</h2>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11nmiZ5FjS70B7wdyKxfg5O-RkC1Var1DhFil2e50jLU/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/images/design/usability-test-slides.png" alt="Slideshow for usability testing" /></a>

### Key Takeaways and Final Notes

- Test often and prioritize small focused tests over big tests
- Use usability testing to discover problems before they are too difficult to fix
- Don't get defensive and fight the urge to explain the interface to your test subjects
- Whenever possible, get as many of your teammates to participate as observers
- Take time to debrief as soon after the test as possible

---

<h2>Student Led Usability Tests</h2>

The rest of class will provide you with opportunities to conduct usability tests. Feel free to use **your own** or any other sites. By the end of the day, you should have conducted and debriefed from 2-3 tests.

### Preparations

- In your scrum group, decide on 2-3 sites to test
- Determine your roles (tester, test subject, observers (devs, designers))
- **Test subject should not be present for the task question planning**
- Pick the tasks that you want your user to test

### The Test

- Follow the pattern noted above

### Debrief

- For the debrief, any member of the team can host it
- Test Subjects can meet in the test subject area and debrief on their experiences as well
