### Making changes in a Branch

***Scenario:*** You are working on developing a simple index.html website for a personal project. Your task is to add a navigation bar, header/hero section and footer section to the website by creating and merging branches into the main codebase.

Instructions:

1. Setup:
	- Clone the repository for the simple website project from a remote repository.
	- Ensure Git is installed on your system and set up your local environment.

2. Create Feature Branches:
	- Create feature branches for each of the following features you'll be adding to the website:
		- Add a navigation bar (201-ach-5-feature/navigation)

	- Use the following command to create a new branch:
	
		```
		$ git checkout -b 201-ach-5-feature/navigation
		```

3. Implement Features:
	- Work on your assigned feature in your feature branch by editing the index.html file.
	- Each feature might include adding HTML elements, styling with CSS, or adding JavaScript
	functionality.
	- Add and commit changes to this branch.
	- Push this branch to GitHub.

	```
	$ git push --set-upstream origin 201-ach-5-feature/navigation
	```

4. Testing and Review:
	- Once your feature is implemented, test it locally to ensure it works as expected.
	- Review your code and commit messages to ensure clarity and readability.

5. Merge Feature Branches into Main:
	- After completing the development and testing phase, it's time to merge your feature branch into the main codebase.
	- Switch to the main branch:

	```
	$ git checkout main
	```
	- Merge your feature branch into the main branch:

	```
	$ git merge 201-ach-5-feature/navigation
	```

6. Resolve Conflicts (if any):
	- If there are any conflicts during the merge process, resolve them by carefully reviewing the conflicting files and making necessary adjustments.
	- Use git status and git diff to identify conflicting files and resolve conflicts manually.

7. Push Changes to Remote Repository:
	- After resolving conflicts and successfully merging your feature branch into the main branch, push the changes to the remote repository:

	```	
	$ git push origin main
	```

8. Create a header section (201-ach-5-feature/header)
	- Create feature branches for each of the header feature you'll be adding to the website:
		- Use the following command to create a new branch:
			```
			$ git checkout -b 201-ach-5-feature/header
			```
	- Repeat steps 2-7 with the ***"201-ach-5-feature/header"*** branch

9. Implement a footer section (201-ach-5-feature/footer)
	- Create feature branches for each of the footer feature you'll be adding to the website:
		- Use the following command to create a new branch:
			```
			$ git checkout -b 201-ach-5-feature/footer
			```
	- Repeat steps 2-7 with the ***"201-ach-5-feature/footer"*** branch

### Submission Instructions
Publish the `main` branch to GH Pages and submit the following to Brightspace:
- GH repo

- GH Pages link

- Links to the 3 branches that you pushed
	- You can select the branch in a drop-down menu on your repo home page.
