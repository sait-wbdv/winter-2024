<h2>Javascript Review</h2>

Git any questions about any Javascript you've covered so far?
- Expressions(produces a value) vs statements(performs an action (combination of expressions))
- Primitive/Basic JS data types(strings(string literals), numbers, booleans, undefined vs null);
- Complex data types (arrays, objects and functions)
- DOM Manipulation

2. Clone the fork to your workspace.
3. Choose [an Issue](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/bookstore/issues) and fix it.
	- Optional: make your changes within a separate branch.
4. Push your changes to GitHub.
5. Create a Pull Request.
	- **Link your PR to your chosen Issue** by [using a keyword in the PR description or as a comment](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword).
