### Morning Activity: Plan out an App feature

1. Choose from one of the following:
    - accordion toggle
    - carousel
    - dark mode toggle
    - mobile nav menu
2. pseudocode how you assume this should work
    - start with your current knowledge of js
    - step through each phase as you view them
3. Note unknowns for practice
    - pay attention to what you didn't know how to do
    - research into behaviours that seem unfamiliar
4. Adjust pseudocode to reflect new knowledge

#### Creating a proof of concept of this will be your afternoon activity

<h2> 1. Statements vs Expressions</h2>

[![Slides - Statements vs Expressions](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-expressions-vs-statements.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-expressions-vs-statements)

### Key Takeaways

- statements contain expressions
- if a chunk of js returns undefined, it's a statement (otherwise it's an expression)
- all the operators we've covered are functions that return values --> **expressions**

### Activity
- Create 2 functions that log different things to the console
- connect 1 to a button using an event listener
- connect 1 to a button using onclick

<h2>3. matchMedia and classListToggle</h2>

### matchMedia
- [mdn documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia)
- [javacript media queries](https://css-tricks.com/working-with-javascript-media-queries/)
- matchMedia is how javascript hooks into media quieries

### classList
- [mdn documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList)
- used to change and manipulate an html elements css classes
- useful especially for darkmode and other such features

### Syntax and Concept Review

- string, array, object, or Math methods
- Manipulating things with functions
- Variables and displaying them on an html page

### Demonstrations

- **finished example**: [Responsive Navigation](https://codepen.io/lilyx/pen/zYyeLaP)
  - follow up with things we've started
  - demo using matchMedia and classList

</LessonPlan>

### Lab Activity: Code your feature from this morning

- Working from your pseudocode, create a minimal implementation of the code you planned
- Use a test repo (not a part of a project or anything)
- Prior to writing code, document your primary goal (and avoid deviating too much)
- Try to build it
  - avoid using chatGPT for direct code generation, as clarifying questions etc, but make sure that you are the one coming up with the scripts
- Submit your repo or codepen to the dailies dropbox for today at the end of lab
