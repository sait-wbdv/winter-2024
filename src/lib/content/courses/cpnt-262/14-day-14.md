<h2>Quick Morning Demo: Adding Tailwind to Vue</h2>

- [Instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite#vue)

<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Code Spike Session</h2>

A code spike is a focused intensive learn about a particular topic. Today we'll be focused on pre-setting filtered values to improve app performance

- **Code this in a vue file in codepen**

- In your groups, Practice working with filter and reduce
- discuss briefly use cases for these two methods. search google and prompt ai for ideas if needed
- Everyone should pick 1 application of 1 of these methods (try to have 2 and 2)
- Work off of the following gists for some more ideas on how to use it

### Instructions and Tips

- [Reduce Method](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/279dcb2a10697068bea8b18ad93eca33)

- [filter method](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/0d43e6090359261028c7a8ddc1109ecc)

### Debrief

- Discuss and demonstrate your filters and reductions to one another.
- share code and/or experiment with each other's implementations

<h2> Computed Properties</h2>

- [Computed docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed)
- Use computed properties in your `script` tag to avoid adding logic to your template
- computed properties are less reactive and resource hungry than `methods`
- Use them for things like:
  - organizing a list by A-Z **or** Z-A
  - making calculations
  - modifying template content
- To use a computed property, simply add it's name to the `{{ }}` where you would put a normal variable's name
- Try it out [in the vue playground link on this page](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html)

### Activity: Set up computed props

- Use the filters and reductions from our first activity
- as these are often used for calculations that don't change, create a list of content (users, characters, products...) (have 3-10 elements)
- set up a filtered and/or a sorted versions of the data in the script tags
  - ie:
  ```
  const characters = [{...}, {...}]
  const goodCharacters = // filtered version of characters
  const badCharacters = // filtered version of characters
  const sortedByAgeCharacters = // use sort
  ```
- however do this using vue's computed syntax so that the functions do not need to run on the users system

<h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>

Vue has a few ways for you to render content under different contitions

- The primary one is `v-if/v-else` which removes and adds element from and to the DOM
- another approach is `v-show` which is like setting something to hidden. This is less costly and better for toggles (things that are switched back and forth between)
- **you can put a `v-if` directly on template tags, giving you the ability to have completely different layouts given specific conditions**
- You will want to deal with most of the logic for conditional logic in the script tags, these directives are for the last step of the conditional lifecycle

### Activity: Conditional Rendering in Components

- Make a component that renders different content based on prop values
  - ie: `if name === 'Shaggy'` render a picture of a scooby snack, `else` render the mystery machine
  - you could also use numerical values **arguably easier to start**
  - remember the `{:else}` clause
- Render styles differently based a prop boolean:
  - ie: a feature card might be different from an info card in few enough ways to use the same component but with conditional rendering
    - suggestion: set the InfoCard to be a default in the `{:else}` and have the Feature card include a button and more visual prominance or something
    - for the prop, you can do this with a boolean prop

<h2>Put it all together</h2>

- In a vue project (this could be in codepen)
- Use all of the techniques learned today to create the basis for a filtering system.
- Use your filtered data from this morning to establish the logic
- Based on filtered fields, use v-if/v-else and/or v-show
- Set up input fields that would make sense regarding your data
- Practice extending and adding other features or filters
