<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- group check in
  - what have you been working on?
  - note recent breakthroughs in your learning
  - note things that have been particularly challenging

### [Reduce Method](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/279dcb2a10697068bea8b18ad93eca33)
- In your groups, review and experiment with the reduce method
- Explore potential use cases (use the examples in the link for direction)
---

### Review Topics

- Pages vs Components
  - syntax differences
  - use case differences
- Rendering Components
  - file organization and naming
  - import syntax
  - props vs slots
  - style props
- Each Syntax for looping
  - destructuring
  - spread operator
  <h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>

- 

### In class Example:

- Render specific images based on conditions

### Activity: Conditional Rendering in Components

- Make a component that renders different content based on prop values
  - ie: `if name === 'Shaggy'` render a picture of a scooby snack, `else` render the mystery machine
  - you could also use numerical values **arguably easier to start**
  - remember the `{:else}` clause
- Render styles differently based a prop boolean:
  - ie: a feature card might be different from an info card in few enough ways to use the same component but with conditional rendering
    - suggestion: set the InfoCard to be a default in the `{:else}` and have the Feature card include a button and more visual prominance or something
    - for the prop, you can do this with a boolean prop
