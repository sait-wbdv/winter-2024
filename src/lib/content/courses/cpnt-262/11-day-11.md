<h2>Morning Scrum</h2>

Discuss the following in your groups
- What are your biggest pain points about javascript?
- What features do you want to see in a framework to make your life as a developer easier?
- What do you know about javascript libraries and their roles in software development?

### Class Debrief

As a class we will walk through the pain points that we are having with javascript as well as features that we would like to have built into how we write our code.

<h2>Frontend Frameworks</h2>

- Frontend Frameworks are designed to make complex websites and applications easier to create. They offer many advances over traditional vanilla html + css + js.
- [Check out Mozillas Documentation on what a frontend framework is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/Introduction)
- Frontend Frameworks can be used for:
  - [Single Page Applications -- SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) loads website on the client side
  - [Server Side Rendered -- SSR](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction) loads website on the server first
  - [Static Site Generation](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/) A static prebuilt site is served to the user (SSG like Nuxt will then 'rehydrate' on the client side, providing a dynamic experience)
- Popular Frameworks:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/) (Facebook)
  - [Angular](https://angular.io/) (Google)
  - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) (Independent/Community)
  - [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) (Independent/Community)

### Why are we using Vue?

- Vue has a rich ecosystem with lots to offer
- It tends to be easier to learn from vanilla html and javascript
- It's mature
- It's got great documentation and a vibrant community

### What's the difference between Vue and Nuxt?

- Nuxt is built using Vue. It is a Vue Framework that offers a lot of functionality built into it
- Vue is the essential core of [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org), just like React is the essential core of [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- Nuxt provides project organization, build tool setup, and an easy way to handle modules and plugins, it also offers static site generation out of the box

### Do I have to stick with one framework?

- Not at all!
  - The goal is that with our basics in Vue and Nuxt, you'll develop a familiarity with general principles common to other frontend frameworks and will be able to pick one that suits your programming style and philosophy

### Vue and Vscode?

- Try using the [volar extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)
- Some work might be needed to get eslint and prettier to work with volar
- [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) is another exellent (but slightly older) extension for vue
  - it can be set to work well with prettier

<h2>VueJS: How to add it to a project</h2>

### Progressive Adoption/Usage

- Vue can be added to a project _progressively_ by adding it to javascript or html pages [see this **without build tools** example](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html#without-build-tools)
  - This gives you the ability to add a bit of vue to a project without needing build tools
  - It also allows you to use just a minimal amount of vue syntax in an otherwise non vue project
- We will be using Single File Components, however it's worth while to try adding vue syntax to existing non vue projects or codepens to see the flexibility this framework gives you

### With Build Tools/Single File Components

- This is likely the way that you will most often encounter vue
- You've already seen a version of this by using [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/), Vue has it's own build tools, cli, and gui for setting up projects.
- You can also use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) which is an alternative build tool to webpack
- A vue project is built around using single file components
  - These include the `script`, `template`, and `style` code blocks

#### Anatomy of a Single File Component

```
<template>

<!-- Write HTML here -->

</template>

<script setup>

// Write Javascript here

</script>

<style scoped>

/* Write CSS here */

<style>
```

- All 3 are not always required.
- using `style scoped`, you can keep your css variables bound at the component level, which increases modularity of your code
- You can rearrange the tags in any order.
  - it's common to see template - script - style. However some developers are placing the script tag ahead of template. It's up to you which style you prefer

#### activity: Experiment with a vue SFC

- [vue sfc practice space](https://sfc.vuejs.org)
- Add variables to the script tag just like you would in javascript
- Try rendering them in the template tag by using moustache syntax `{{ variableName }}`
- add conditional rendering inline in the double moustache syntax. ie: `{{ score > 10 ? 'yay you win!' : 'boo, you lose'}}`

<h2>Vue Directives Basics</h2>

- Vue has a set of templating directives that you can use to add content to a web page. There are lots and they are all useful for different things. Today we will cover a couple basics to get you started
- [Directives List](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html)

#### [`v-bind`](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-bind)

- This is one of the most important. it allows you to bind data to html properties such as `src` in an img tag
- You can also use it to bind styles [v-bind css](https://vuejs.org/api/sfc-css-features.html#v-bind-in-css)
- It can be written out as `v-bind:src="variableName"` or by using the shorthand `:` as in `:src="variableName`
- Example:

```
<img :src="cat.photo" :alt="cat.description" />
```

#### [v-for](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-for)

- Use v-for to render a loop of information
- It **must** have a key added. which should be the name of the iterator + .id
- example (will print out a list of hero names providing that `heroes` exists as a list)

```
<ul>
  <li v-for="hero in heroes" :key="hero.id">
  {{ hero.name }}
  </li>
</ul>
```

#### [v-slot](https://vuejs.org/api/built-in-directives.html#v-slot)

- This allows you to create space inside a component for extra content to be added in specific uses
- In your component, you use a `v-slot` to tell the component what to do with the extra info

### Activity: Render a list with v-for
- Create an array in the script tags
- add a v-for to your code, probably connected to a li element (the v-for will duplicate whatever it's attached to)
- use double moustache to render the variables
- Extra challenge:
	- use an array of objects
	- include src image links
	- data bind the image src and the alt text

<h2>Vue Composition API vs Options API</h2>

- When you look up Vue documentation and examples, you'll find two distinct types of syntax being used. One is the **options api** and the other is the **composition api**.
- The Options API is older and will be eventually replaced by the composition api
- They are both useful ways of structuring the logic for your code. They handle your variables, functions, and props.
- [API Reference Appendix](https://vuejs.org/api/)
- **In this class we will default to the composition api**

### Comparative Example

- Options API

```
<script>
export default {
  data() {
    variableKey: 'Variable Value'
  }
}
</script>
```

- Composition API

```
<script setup>
const variableKey = 'Variable Value'
</script>
```

### Activity: Refactor data from the options api to the composition api

#### Part 1

- Navigate to the [vue tutorial space](https://vuejs.org/tutorial/#step-1)
- Select SFC and Composition API
- Add a couple of variables inside a script tag
  - Start of with simple string variables
- render them using moustache syntax

#### Part 2

- Open another tab with the vuejs tutorial space in it
- Select SFC and Options API
- Try to recreate the data binding from your first example using options api syntax
