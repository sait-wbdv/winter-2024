<h2>CPNT-262 Course High Level Overview</h2>

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zu5ruNcKQ8knm2fPr0zGaTRhR9PXsYKGWdPqwoxjXww/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/images/slides/cpnt-262/cpnt-262-overview.png" alt="class intro slide" /></a>

- **Objectives**:
  - to learn fundamentals about computer programming
  - to be able to build websites using modern technologies
  - **to create a foundation for your future in tech**
- **How to be successful at programming**:
  - pseudocode, pseudocode, pseudocode
  - focus on problem solving
  - spending enough time practicing to understand concepts
  - collaborate with others
  - avoid comparing yourself to others
  - don't copy/paste code without understanding how it works (stack overflow, chatgpt)
- [Debugging Strategy Gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/e5b3e34c8918134127cd34d1bf270a63)
- a workflow for solving code problems

<h2>Flow Charts</h2>

[![Slides - Flowcharts](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-flowcharts.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-flowcharts)

### Activity: Algorithms in Everyday Life (30 minutes)

**Focus**: Anything goes! (within a sharable school context)

<a href="https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/423ffbe6e8da87497b134985ba90ab15">
  <h3>Instructions Link</h3>
  <img src="/images/qr-codes/algorithm-activity.png" alt="activity qr code" class="w-48">
</a>

1. (Individually) Create a flowchart of something that you enjoy doing using the instructions provided (15 minutes)
2. Discuss your findings in your teams 15 minutes:

- What activity did you document? What step(s) did you break down into micro steps?
- **Walk each other through your steps**
- When broken into micro steps, did you underestimate how complex the activity actually was?
- give one another feedback about potentially assumed information in the flow chart
- take note of situations where the following occurs:
  - A **conditional** situation where the important results happen based on input/choice
  - A **loop** happens where something is repeated, when does the loop end and what happens at every iteration
  - There is/are object(s) that have multiple relevant properties (ie: a person getting a hair cut would have hair at a certain length, color..)
  - An action is executed. What changes due to the action, who performs the action, and does the action always affect the same things

3. Class Debrief:

- each team will address one of the 4 items discussed above (loop, condition, variable, function)

  - How were your examples of the thing different? did everyone have an example of it?

<h2>Computational Thinking</h2>

### Lecture Slides

<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1U9YnVCE4kvZzt2Fgc-QoFZkA6wEQFfUo6lgjl72dCdU/edit?usp=sharing"><img src="/images/slides/cpnt-262/computational-thinking.png" alt="computational thinking slides" /></a>

### Key Takeaways

- Words, images, numbers... everything that we see on computers are representations of binary values
- Programming logic can be viewed in flowcharts
- **Variables** are "buckets" that hold **values**
- When we think programmatically, we are breaking complex tasks down into small steps and dictating the results at each given step

---

<h2>Pseudo Code</h2>

- Pseudocode is used to think through the steps of an algorithm
  - it exists between the flowcharting and code implementation phases
  - normally pseudocode is written in comments in your actual code
  - when pseudocoding, you move from how a human thinks to how a computer thinks
    - your pseudocode will look like a number of things along this spectrum
- [Geeks for Geeks Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-write-a-pseudo-code/)

### Activity: Turn your flowchart into pseudocode

- create a `script.js` file in vscode
- Turn your flowchart into pseudocode using comments
  - ie:
  ```
  // goal: walk to the grocery story
    // leave house
      // open front door
      // walk outside
      // close front door
      // lock front door
    // begin walking in the correct direction
      // turn left
      // step one foot after the other
    // at intersection wait for it to be safe to cross
      // if a car is still driving
        // wait
      // if a car is stopping
        // walk
      // if there is no car
        // walk
  ```
- Submit your pseudocode to the appropriate dropbox (this is not for grades, just for me to give you feedback)

<h2>Scratch</h2>

- [Scratch Website](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- Scratch is a visual programming language made at MIT
- It's used to teach programming principles and build fun things
- Scratch uses a building block approach to coding which provides a great **mental model** for writing code

<h2>Javascript setup on your computer</h2>

- Install Node on your computer:
  - **Easy** - [Binary Installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - **Maybe Tricky** - [Try nvm](https://www.google.com/search?q=nvm+getting+started) for that pro look.
- VS Code Extensions:

  - Install the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) extension for VS Code **Linter**
    - helps detect bugs
  - Install the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension for VS Code **Formatter** - helps detect bad code style
  - Install [TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wayou.vscode-todo-highlight)(optional)
    - indicates TODO: tags in your code comments
