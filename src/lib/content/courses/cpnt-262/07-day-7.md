<h2>Prep</h2>

- Look up javascript string methods
  - try to use 5 of them with sample content in a js file
  - note at least 1 example per method of an application of where it would be useful.
- Try the [Javascript array methods tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/complete-introduction-to-the-most-useful-javascript-array-methods/)

<h2>String Methods</h2>

### Activity: Code Spike String Methods

A code spike is a short focused study on a technical aspect of a project with the objective of testing whether or not the code/library/approach etc will be viable. This often involves communicating details about the code spike with other members of a team.

You will get to do a mini version of this in your scrum groups where you'll each spend a bit of time researching some code and demonstrate how to use it to one another.

#### 20 min - Code Learning & Practice
In your scrum groups, Each of you will pick a use case oriented category and explore the string methods associated with it (take a couple minutes to divide them up before you start). **choose from the following**


- **Data Validation and Sanitization:**
  - Methods: startsWith(), endsWith(), includes(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim()
- **Text Processing and Manipulation:**
  - Methods: join(), replace(), substring(), indexOf(), pop(), shift, unshift(), slice(), splice()
- **Formatting and Presentation:**
  - Methods: repeat(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), trim()
- **User Input Handling:**
  - Methods: trim(), toLowerCase(), toUpperCase(), split(), join(), replace().


Take note of a use case for each method and provide a simple demo to your teammates of how to use it.

#### 10 minutes: Mini Demos

Take turns explaining 2 of your methods to each other and what they do. Focus on the differences between them as they will all be similar but with minor variances.

- Explain what you were learning how to do and common use cases
- Demonstrate 2 methods with a simple example
- Discuss a key takeaway that you gained from this code spike.

<h2>Array Methods</h2>


[![Slides - Javascript array methods](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-higher-order-array-methods.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-higher-order-array-methods)

### Key Takeaways

- JS provides powerful methods for editing array elements
- `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`, `.reduce()`, `.slice()`, `.sort()`, `.includes()` are all highly specialized

### Activity: Code Spike Array Methods

This is the same as the first activity, however you'll be looking at array methods this time.

#### 20 min - Code Learning & Practice
Just like before, choose from the following topics:

Take note of a use case for each method and provide a simple demo to your teammates of how to use it.
- **Iteration and Manipulation:**
  - forEach(callbackFunction): Execute a function for each element.
  - map(callbackFunction): Create a new array by applying a function to each element.
  - filter(callbackFunction): Create a new array with elements that pass a test.
  - reduce(callbackFunction, initialValue): Reduce the array to a single value by applying a function.
- **Searching and Filtering:**
  - indexOf(searchElement, fromIndex): Find the first occurrence of an element.
  - lastIndexOf(searchElement, fromIndex): Find the last occurrence of an element.
  - includes(searchElement, fromIndex): Check if the array contains an element.
  - find(callbackFunction): Find the first element that passes a test.
  - findIndex(callbackFunction): Find the index of the first element that passes a test.
- **Adding, Removing, and Sorting:**
  - push(element): Add an element to the end of the array.
  - pop(): Remove and return the last element from the array.
  - shift(): Remove and return the first element from the array.
  - unshift(element): Add an element to the beginning of the array.
  - sort(compareFunction): Sort the elements of the array in place.
  - splice(startIndex, deleteCount, ...items): Add/remove elements at a specific index.
- **Data Transformation and Aggregation:**
  - concat(...arrays): Combine multiple arrays into a single array.
  - slice(start, end): Extract a part of the array based on index positions.
  - join(separator): Join an array of strings into a single string with a separator.
  - every(callbackFunction): Check if all elements pass a test.
  - flat(depth): Flatten an array of nested arrays to a single level.

#### 10 minutes: Mini Demos

Take turns explaining your methods to each other and what they do. Focus on the differences between them as they will all be similar but with minor variances.

- Explain what you were learning how to do and common use cases
- Demonstrate 2 methods with simple examples
- Discuss a key takeaway that you gained from this code spike.
