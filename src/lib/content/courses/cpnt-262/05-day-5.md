<h2>Prep</h2>

- [Read What are Functions in Javascript](<https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-functions-in-javascript-a-beginners-guide/#:~:text=A%20function%20is%20a%20block,prompt()%2C%20and%20confirm().>)
- **For Discussion**: Browse the web and find 5 examples of actions that you can do
  - if you can't find examples on websites, try web apps and video games

### Scrum Retrospective

- How has your work gone this week?
- What topics are making sense? and which ones arent? - elaborate
- What do you feel like you need more of for your learning?
- What did you do well / what are your proud of?

<h2>Calculator Demo</h2>

1. Walk through our code from where we left off
2. Note things that are working, not working, buggy, poorly designed, or in a general state of disrepair
3. Plan what your goals are
4. Outline your brute force method
5. **Implement your code**

- After the bruteforce code demo, we will take 20 minutes for everyone to work on their own implementations

### Optimization Phase

1. Walk through your code and note things to improve
   - look for disorganized code
   - look for error handling needs
   - look for logic that needs to be expanded
2. Decide on optimizations to make and begin doing them
   - do them 1 at a time
   - pick the most important or one that others are dependent upon to start with
   - decide on how far you want to go
   - do any needed research
3. Improve your code
   - walk through the code and fix things up in order
   - if you need to stop, leave TODO: messages so you remember later
   - avoid jumping around or starting new things while doing this

<h2>1. Introduction to Functions</h2>

[![Intro to functions](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-functions.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-functions)

### Key Takeaways

- Functions make code re-usable and portable
- Functions make code safer
- Declare a function to make it invocable, invoke it to use it
- JS has traditional **and** fat-arrow syntax for functions
- Functions can take parameters as arguments
- Functions return values

### Activity: Create Calculator Helper Functions

- Review your code and look for logic that can be extracted into functions (ie: math operations)
- try to extract a few pieces of logic (2-5) into helper functions
- implement the functions where your logic was previously
- Push your code (and submit to the dailies codebox for day 5 if you would like it reviewed)

<h2>2. Naming Conventions</h2>

There are some patterns for naming conventions for variables and functions that can be really helpful for readability

### Booleans

- prefix with **is** and **has**
  - ie: `isActive`, `hasId`

### Functions

- prefix with a verb, use a descriptive noun
  - ie: `getUserName()`, `calculateTotalCost()`

### Variables

- treat like nouns, be clear and concise
  - ie: `userName`, `currentSlide`
- avoid super general names
- sometimes it's convention to use single letter names
  - ie: `i` for a loop iterator, `e` for event

<h2>End of Day Activity DRYing code with functions</h2>

DRY &#8594; Don't Repeat Yourself

- [Starter code](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/dailies-w23/tree/main/2023-02-23-functions/01-tip-calculator-starter)

### Phase 1: Dry out code

- copy this code (fork or download) and have it inialized as a repo in github
- follow the refactor instructions
- make sure that the right values are logged

### Phase 2: Render values to an html page

- create an index.html file and connect the js file to it
- use `document.querySelector()` in js with ids in html to display the values on the page

### Phase 3: Make it interactive

- Add input fields
- Refactor the code so that the input data is calculated [follow the in class repo](https://github.com/lilyx13/conditionals-js-html)
- Add error handling so the user cannot calculate non numbers

### Phase 4: Show it off!

- deploy the page and send a link to it as well as the repo in the dailies drop box for today
