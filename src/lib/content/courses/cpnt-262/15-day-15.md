- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?

### Morning Javascript: `.map()`

- Used to return content from a modified array **without** effecting the original array
- [.map() Docummentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [map activities gist](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/efc642ac2af5423666f3403d2a6dff9e)
- **tip**: you can use `.map()` for filtering by using conditionals, but `.filter()` is better suited for that task.

#### Group Instructions (node cli or codepen)
- Pick one of the following to use map in:
	- **node** with built in modules fs and path (create and add content to files)
	- **vanilla js** render a modified version of the array without changing anything in the original
	- **vuejs** use map in the script tags to change content and render it in the document

<h2>Events Review</h2>

- Events are things that happen in JS
- They can be triggered by the user or other factors (such as the page loading)
- Common use cases: toggles, input fields, sliders



### In Class Demonstration: Convert Carousel to Svelte

- **Step 1**: Migrate vanilla code and set up assets and rendering variations
- Objective: Build a carousel that can be used on any page
- Content: render an array of images with descriptions
- Conditional example: set up 2 elements to feature special content

<h2 id="vue-events">Vue Events</h2>



### In Class Demonstration: Make the carousel interactive

1. Configure the buttons
2. Check for potential event modifiers that we may want to use
3. Test
4. Deploy

### In Class Activity: Create a darkmode toggle

- Use tailwind css and svelte's event handling to toggle between dark and light mode
- [Tailwind Dark Mode Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)

### Lab Activities

- easy mode: create a mobile nav menu using v-on
- medium mode: create an accordion that opens and closes
- hard mode: interact with the users's cursor and trigger actions based on it's position
- Darkmode toggle

#### Extra Challenge
- add transition effects to your toggles so that movement feels smooth and natural
