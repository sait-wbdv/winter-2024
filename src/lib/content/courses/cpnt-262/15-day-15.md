<h2>Mini Assignment 4: Framework Reactivity</h2>

- [Assignment Instructions](/courses/cpnt-262/assessments/activity-4)
- Due: Monday March 11th

<h2>Component planning warmup</h2>

working with the people around you, plan out components and their props for a webpage

1. Pick a website together
2. identify a component pattern for each person in the group
3. Create a vue 3 SFC in codepen
4. Create the props, sample content, and html markup to render the general layout of these components
5. **TIP** look up default values for vue props. you can use these to set fallbacks

<h2 id="vue-events">Vue Events</h2>

- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/event-handling.html)
- [v-on gist](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/74543137780c1958f01e9b470a3cb13b) with notes on how to use `v-on`
- `v-on` is used to listen to DOM events and trigger a javascript handler (often a function)
- syntax: `v-on:click="handler"`
  - or shortened as`@click="handler`
- Use this for any buttons on a page
  - set the handler to be a function
- This can be used with the [`ref()`](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/template-refs.html) to make variables more reactive

### Activity 1: sum the total cost in a shopping cart on click

- using our array from yesterday, calculate the total cost in the shopping cart on click
- create a second button to apply a discount when the cart total is >= $1000

### Activity 2: Logic to Pass data between arrays

- create 2 arrays to pass data between. 1 array should be empty
- create a function that will pass the data from the full array to the empty one
- create a function that will pass the last value back to the first array

### Activity 3: Add buttons so a user can make data pass back and forth

- create 2 buttons and connect them to the functions (moving data in each direction)
- validate that the buttons are passing the values with console logs
- use v-fors to show both lists on the page
- verify that they update with each click

### Event Modifiers

- To stop a form from being submitted when using a `<button>`, or to stop other default behaviour, use `.prevent`
  - `@click.prevent="myFunction`
  - Check out the other event modifiers
    - `@click.once` - will only trigger once
    - `@click.passive` - great for touch events
  - Key modifiers allow for effecting how an event handler is triggered
  - You can specify specific keys using key aliases and key modifiers

<h2>Lifecycle Hooks</h2>

- Lifecycle hooks are common to javascript frameworks. They are the steps for when different parts of the site are initialized.
- This [diagram](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/lifecycle.html) shows the order of which the lifecycle hooks are initialized
- `onMounted()` can be made use of when fetching content

### Activity: console.log a message when `onMounted()` is initialized

- Use the onMounted hook on a vue page to log a message
- log anohter message as per usual

### Lab Activities

Choose one of the following:

#### TailwindCSS Dark Mode Toggle

- Use tailwind css and vue's event handling to toggle between dark and light mode
- [Tailwind Dark Mode Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)

#### User Input with v-model

- Create a login, character creator, or sign up form
- Use `v-model` and `ref()` syntax with a form to access user input
- Do one of the following (depending on your form):
  - validate date with js functions (ie: passwords)
  - render the inputted content onto the dom with stylized elements
  - edit input (ie: a text field for a url generator would replace all spaces with the **-** character)

#### Carousel in Vue

- Rebuild a carousel in VueJS
- Refactor your vanilla js code to work in Vue
