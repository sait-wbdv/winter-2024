<h2>Logic Warmup: The Fox, Goose, and Corn Problem</h2>
- A farmer needs to get a fox, goose, and bag of corn across a river
- the farmer can only move 1 at a time

### Conditions

- The fox cannot be alone with the goose
- The goose cannot be alone with the corn

### Solve with your team

- Outline an algorithmic approach (pseudocode) to solving the fox, goose, and corn problem

<h2>Stores</h2>

All frontend frameworks have a way of handling state, these are usually referred to as stores

### Component State vs Global State vs localStorage

- localStorage can be used to save information in a client's browser. Like session storage, this can be useful for seamless UX, however it can open up security issues... and conflates your app's storage with the client's storage
- **Stores are great for data that is manipulated by many pages and/or components**
- [Pinia Stores](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

### Types of Stores

- writable: data can be modified by "subscribers" (components)
  - use for data that components should change
- readable: data can only be read by "subscribers"
  - use for data that should only be read

#### Example 1: Global Readable Data

- Set up a store with reusable data
- Render the data on multiple routes and components

#### Example 2: Multi Component Counter

- Goal: Break a counter up into multiple components
- render the value on a second page to demonstrate how it can be updated

#### Activity: Built a counter and prep for a "like" tracker

- Finish recreating the counter used
- Plan out how you might use similar logic to track social media likes for a post, image, or other type of media
