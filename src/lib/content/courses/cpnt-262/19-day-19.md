<h2>Logic Warmup: The Fox, Goose, and Corn Problem</h2>
- A farmer needs to get a fox, goose, and bag of corn across a river
- the farmer can only move 1 at a time

### Conditions

- The fox cannot be alone with the goose
- The goose cannot be alone with the corn

### Solve with your team

- Outline an algorithmic approach (pseudocode) to solving the fox, goose, and corn problem

<h2>Dynamic Routes in Nuxt</h2>

### [Demo Repository](https://github.com/sait-wbdv/nuxt-server-api-demo)

- this repo shows how to use the different types of syntax that you may need
  - it shows client side external fetch and server side external fetch
  - it also shows how to pass data from your own endpoints
  - and it shows how to use the [nuxt content module](https://nuxt.com/modules/content)
- Take advantage of these patterns in relation to examples on the official documentation
- Dynamic routes are created by using [] around a keyword (either id or slug)

### File structure (Client Side)

- your folder structure for a blog would look something like this (for the pages)

```
pages/
    users/
        index.vue | the collection page
        [id].vue  | the individual user pages
```

### File structure (server side)

- this should match how you're working in the pages for the easiest workflow
- the [id].js is creating a server api route for each user

```
server/
    api/
        users/
          index.js
          [id].js
```

### Client side data fetching

- in the vue files, use `useFetch()` to query from either your or an exernal api

```
const { id } = useRoute().params;
const { data } = await useFetch(`/api/users/${id}`);
```

### Server side data fetching

```
 const id = event.context.params.id;
 const data = await fetchData(`https://dummyjson.com/users/${id}`);
```

<h2>Stores</h2>

All frontend frameworks have a way of handling state, these are usually referred to as stores

### Component State vs Global State vs localStorage

- localStorage can be used to save information in a client's browser. Like session storage, this can be useful for seamless UX, however it can open up security issues... and conflates your app's storage with the client's storage
- **Stores are great for data that is manipulated by many pages and/or components**
- [Pinia Stores](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- [Nuxt built in state management](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/state-management)

### Types of Stores

- writable: data can be modified by "subscribers" (components)
  - use for data that components should change
- readable: data can only be read by "subscribers"
  - use for data that should only be read

#### Example 1: Global Readable Data

- Set up a store with reusable data
- Render the data on multiple routes and components

#### Example 2: Multi Component Counter

- Goal: Break a counter up into multiple components
- render the value on a second page to demonstrate how it can be updated

#### Activity 1: Build a nav toggle with useState

- create a simple mobile navigation with a toggle
- instead of declaring the togglable variable with a `ref()`, use `useState()`

#### Activity 2: Create global store variables

- create a `/store/` directory and add a `counter` or other file
- set up some stateful variables as per the abovelinked docs
- add the variables to 2 different pages or components
- (extra) create the ability to change the data in one place,
  - but make sure it just reflects the updated data automatically in the other
