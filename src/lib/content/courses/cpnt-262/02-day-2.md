<h2>Prep</h2>

- Skim [What is Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript)
- Watch [Learn JS with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6NZfCO5SIk) for a tutorial oriented dip into Javascript
- Read [A first splash into javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) by the Mdn

### Morning Activity: Merge and Implement our Intersection Code!

#### Phase 1: Talk it out (All hands)

- Outline the overarching goal and parameters
- Review and note each others control flow logic
  - does anything need to change to work together?
- Visualize the functions with props
- Each group should note some changes that they can make to their part of the program

#### Phase 2: Code it (In teams)

- Make the changes to your algorithms as per all hands discussion
- Simulate with props to test
- Write the code down (1 algorithm per page) and label each one clearly based on what it does
- Create any other props needed
- Decide on who will **execute** the program commands and who will operate as variables in the program
  - 1-2 command executers
  - 1-2 variable

#### Phase 3: Run the Program (All hands)

- Now we'll pull it all together!
- The 'variable' will play out the commands executed by the 'functions' using props
- Then let's see how many times we crash the program!
- Document causes of crashes and note potential solutions

<h2> 1. Introduction to Javascript</h2>

[![Introduction to Javascript](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-intro.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-introduction)

### Key Takeaways

- The Browser Triad is **HTML** for content, **CSS** for presentation, and **JS** for behaviour
- Javascript runs in **and** out of the browser
- Add JS to HTML by using a `<script src="" type=""></script>` tag
- camelCase for multi word variables
- JS is case sensitive
- Use whitespace to make code readable

### Small Group Discussion

- What features have you wanted to add to web pages that don't seem possible with html and css?
- Note the focus of the features that you want to add (some examples are listed here)
  - social media
  - user interactions
  - data collection
  - artificial intelligence
- What can you assume about how javascript works based on your work with Scratch?

<h2> 2. Demo: Using the Browser console</h2>

- [Finding Your Browser's Developer Console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/)
- [Useful Devtools tips and tricks](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/06/popular-devtools-tips/)

### Activity: Experiment with the browser console

- Try using [`console.log()`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-console-log-method/) to print out text
  - try using words inside and outside of quotations
  - try using numbers inside and outside of qutotations
  - **what are the differences**
- Create a variable (use the following syntax)
  - `const myName = "insert your name here"` (use any sentence and variable name u want)
- Log the variable that you created with `console.log(myName)` (use the varaible name that you created)

#### Debrief

- What errors did you run into?
  - How did you solve them?

<h2>3. Declaring and assigning variables</h2>

[![Slides - declaring and assigning variables](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-variables.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-variables)

**Materials**:

- [Storing the information you need — Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables)
- [Handling text — strings in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)
- [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)

### Key Takeaways (Variables)

- Declaration creates a variable in memory
- Assignment puts a value in a variable
- `const` variables can be reassigned
- `let` variables can be reassigned
- default to const
- use descriptive variable names with camelCase

#### Discussion

- Open up Scratch and take a look at what you've been working on
- What would be comparable to const and let variables in Scratch?

### Key Takeaways (Types)

- Primitive types = numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined
- Complex types = arrays, objects, functions

### Data Types Activity

- In the browser console, try making and logging one of each of these variable types.
  - string
  - number
  - boolean
  - array
  - object
- Use whatever names and content you want, I recommend to pick a movie, game, or something and pull from that
