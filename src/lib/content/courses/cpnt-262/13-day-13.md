<h2 id="scrum-meeting">Scrum Session</h2>

- what have you been working on?
- what do you plan to be doing?
- do you have any blocks?

### Activity
- Find ui elements that are repeated on a web page with **different content** (ie: a button, card, accordion layout, header...)
- mood board as a team and sketch out the props and classes that change on implementation
- use sticky notes to document specifically the fields that require information
- TIP: any e-commerce store will have a lot of examples to draw from

---

<h2>Components</h2>

- Components separate our code just like modules, but a single file vue component bundles in the needed logic, content, and style into 1 file
- A static component doesnt' need any props or anything. however usually a component will take props to get more mileage out of the component


## Props

- Use props to pass information from parent components to child components
- props are **one way binding** for 2 way binding, use `v-model`
- [Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/components/props.html#props)

### A little on defining props
- if you are going to edit the prop data in the script, write this:
```
const props = defineProps({
	// props go here
})
```
- if you are not going to edit the props with javascript, you can do this:
```
defineProps({
	// props go here
})
```

### Activity: Make a Link Primary Action Component
- Create an `AppButton.vue` Component (or `AppLink`)
- Give it a text and href prop
- Use it in a page header section (with a primary and secondary action)
	- ie: Learn More | Shop Now


### Activity 2: Add style props

- [Class and style bindings](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/class-and-style.html)
- Extend your button's design by giving it the ability to change color
- Pick a convention:
	- primary and secondary props are predetermined with set colors
	- can take a developer defined color and add it to styles
	- pass a tailwind color into it
	- default as secondary, use a primary flag to turn on primary colors
- code tips:
	- use ternary operators, class bindings, and boolean logic

<h2> Computed Properties</h2>

- [Computed docs](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed)
- Use computed properties in your `script` tag to avoid adding logic to your template
- computed properties are less reactive and resource hungry than `methods`
- Use them for things like:
  - organizing a list by A-Z **or** Z-A
  - making calculations
  - modifying template content
- To use a computed property, simply add it's name to the `{{ }}` where you would put a normal variable's name
- Try it out [in the vue playground link on this page](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/computed.html)

### Activity: Set up computed props
- as these are often used for calculations that don't change, create a list of content (users, characters, products...) (have 3-10 elements)
- set up a filtered and/or a sorted versions of the data in the script tags
	- ie: 
	```
	const characters = [{...}, {...}]
	const goodCharacters = // filtered version of characters
	const badCharacters = // filtered version of characters
	const sortedByAgeCharacters = // use sort
	```
- however do this using vue's computed syntax so that the functions do not need to run on the users system


</LessonPlan>

<Achievement {status}>

- [Example Repo](https://github.com/ashx3s/node-examples)

<h2>Lab Activity: Use components with a filtered list of data</h2>

- bring together computed props, v-for (for list rendering in the template) and a component that uses props to render content
- characters, shopping lists, todo lists are all good examples for this
- create a repo with vue
- bonus: try deploying to [vercel](https://vercel.com)
