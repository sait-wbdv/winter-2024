### Morning Activity: Interactivity Treasure Hunt (15 minutes)

- Find 10 examples of interactivity on web pages.
- Things to look for:
  - anything with a button
  - sliders
  - carousels
  - things where the cursor is tracked

<h2>1. Conditionals</h2>

[![Conditional Slides](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-conditional-code.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-conditional-code)

### Key Takeaways

- Conditional statements are based in boolean truthy/falsy options
- an if block doesn't _need_ and else block
  - the else block is generally used when there is an `else if` block
- JS has equality and **strict equality**
- any value can be converted to a boolean value

### Error Handling and Fail Fast with if statements

- inside your functions, use simple if statements to check variable types and other conditions and return nothing.
- This is often used with expressions like:
  - `if (isNaN(value)) { return }` or `if (inputValue.length <= 0) { return}`

### Switch Statements

- An alternative to if/else conditionals are switch statements
- These tend to be lighter and easier to read
- [Here is an article that talks about the differences between switch and if else](https://medium.com/@michellekwong2/switch-vs-if-else-1d458e7b0711)

### Ternary Operators

Another way that you can check conditionals is [ternary operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator)

- Thes are great for simple in line functions
- Unlike an if statement, an else condition is required
- they are often used to check null values

  - ie:

  ```
  const greeting = (person) => {
    const name = person ? person.name : 'stranger';
    return `Hello ${name}`
  }
  ```

### Think it out activity: pseudocode conditional logic

- Pick one of the tasks from the end of day activity list to pseudo code
- Plan out your logic as we've been practicing
  - identify the objective
  - identify variables
  - outline the logic
  - identify unknowns and uncertains
  - research and test

<h2>2. Javascript and Forms</h2>

[![Javascript Forms Slides](/images/slides/cpnt-262/js-forms.png)](/slides/cpnt-262/js-forms)

### Key Takeaways

- Use the form element if:
  - you're submitting data to a server
  - the controls are triggered by a submit button
- [extra info on button type=submit vs input type=submit](https://html.com/attributes/button-type/#:~:text=Both%20%3Cbutton%20type%3D%22submit,it%20is%20a%20null%20element).
- `event.preventDefault()` is important for when the page shouldn't refresh on submit

### End of Day Activity: Create something using conditional logic

Using a git repo create one of the following. You'll need to use a mix of forms and conditional code (these are listed from easiest to hardest)

- An automatic greeter
- A counter with min and max value limits
- A calculator with input fields
- A calculator with buttons
