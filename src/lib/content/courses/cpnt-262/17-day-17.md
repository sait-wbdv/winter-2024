- Read: [What is a rest api](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api)
- Skim: [useful rest api list](https://rapidapi.com/blog/most-popular-api/)
  - find ones that are easy and interesting to use for sample work

- Example Repo: [Nuxt Repo with server fetches](git@github.com:sait-wbdv/cprg-day-04-sample-code.git)
  - this repo demonstrates server side fetch calls (as well as supabase integration if you want to see what that's going to look like in a few weeks)

<h2>Shopping Cart Challenge Review</h2>

Everyone is eligible for a gift card for tims or starbucks!

- To get a gift card, send your code in the appropriate drop box in d2l
- Then as teams, each group will present their code and walk through their logic with the class
- Mini Presentations should address the following content (each person needs to talk about at least 1 part of how the code works):
  - demonstrate the interface
  - walk through your code (pick 1 person's code to use, if there are multiple solutions, address the variations in approach as necessary)
  - identify major challenges that you ran into and how you worked through them

---

<h2>Error Handling Review</h2>

- [try / catch statements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)
  - attempt to run code and handle an error if it fails
- [throw new Error()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw)
  - create custom error messages
- [console.error()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console/error)
  - output more useful error messages

### Example Syntax of all 3 methods used together

```js
let a = "1";
let b = 2;

function add(numOne, numTwo) {
  try {
    if (typeof numOne !== "number" || typeof numTwo !== "number") {
      throw new Error("at least one of the input values is not a number");
    } else {
      return a + b;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}
// execute the function
add(a, b);
// Expected output-- Error: at least one of the input values is not a number
```

<h2 id="rest-api"> 1. REST API</h2>

- [Explanatory Video](https://youtu.be/PfujVETI-i4?si=qcRbOcBk-tRWHwz0)
  - **RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer
  - Request Types:
    - [Get Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET): for retrieving data
    - [Post Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST): for sending data
    - [Put Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT): To replace data (update)
    - [Delete Request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE): to remove data (destructive)
- CRUD Operations are used to interact with a rest api, rest api's serve data
  - Create = Get
  - Retrieve = POST
  - Update = PUT
  - Delete = Delete
- Using a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), you can test endpoints and work on constructing queries
  - these queries can be used in your apps to handle server fetch calls
  - a major task when working on this is to put together fetches that are performant by only fetching as much data as is needed

### Activity: Use the VsCode Postman Plugin to fetch from an api

- [Disney API](https://disneyapi.dev/)
- [Postman VSCode Extension](https://blog.postman.com/introducing-the-postman-vs-code-extension/)
- [Disney API Documentation](https://disneyapi.dev/docs/)

#### Tasks

- fetch all characters
- fetch a single character

<h2 id="async-js">2. Async Javascript</h2>

- Used for functions that may take a long time such as fetching data from an api `fetch()
- Allows processes to happen while the async function is running
- There are different syntaxes that have been used over time.
  - [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) where promises are chained together is a recent method
  - **however** the modern and the clearest way to write asynchronous code is with `async/await` syntax
  - [async/await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

### Syntax Example

```js
async function fetchDataFromApi(url) {
  try {
    const response = fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP Error. Status: ${response.status}`);
    }
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
}
```

### Challenges working with Async Code

- Because they return promises that data will be there you can't use the data fetched the same as a static variable
- Callback Hell: this is difficult to read code from nesting too many callbacks (an older issue that was addressed first with Promise syntax)
- Promise Confusion: this happens with the `.then`, `.catch`, and `.finally` parts of javascript's promise syntax. These methods are strung together to handle async code and can be challenging to work with at first
- Debugging: this is hard with async code because it doesn't work linearly.

<h2>Activity</h2>

In your scrum groups, create fetch calls to your choice of [public api's](https://apipheny.io/free-api/). There are lots out there, this list will get you started.

- Pick 1-3 api's to fetch data from (stick with Disney if you want more practice there)
- First craft fetch calls with postman, use the documentation for your api to figure out how to write the fetch
- Then recreate your fetch in a javascript file and log the data
- Then see if you can render the data to an html page
- Make sure to catch errors
- Finally, migrate your code to Nuxt and use the [useFetch](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch) composable in `/server/api/apiFile.js` to fetch data

<h2>Team Sprint Planning: 30 min - 1 hour</h2>

- Take a few minutes to check in on where everyone's at
- Set objectives for the week
- Create issues in your Github project (these will be the steps to secure your objectives)
  - make sure to include a **Definition of Done** for each task so it's clear what needs to happen
- Assign tasks to team members

<h2>Lab Activity</h2>

- Finish up and push your data fetching examples to github
- Individually submit your own repos to dailies
