<h2>Authentication vs Authorization</h2>

<dl>
	<dt>RLS</dt>
	<dd>Row-level Security is PostgreSQL's (the database engine used by Supabase) method of auth for each row of a database table.</dd>
	<dt>Access Policies</dt>
	<dd>PostgreSQL's method of allowing access to each row in a database table.</dd>
</dl>

[![Slides - Authentication vs Authorization](/images/slides/authentication-vs-authorization.png)](https://sait-wbdv.github.io/slides/w23/cpnt-200/authentication-authorization.html)

### Key Takaways

- In _Supabase_: - Authentication happens first with the `<anon>` `apiKey` token. - Authorization happens second with the `Authorization` Bearer token.
- Even if RLS is _Disabled_, users still need an `<anon>` API key to read or make changes to a database table.

### Enable Row Level Security

- The last thing we will do today is enable RLS policies for our tables.
- Find this in the **Authentication** Tab, in Policies, you can add RLS policies
- Once you do, you won't be able to fetch anymore
- However if you add a new policy for read access to anyone, you'll be again able to retrief data, but it'll only be readable (before you could also push data)

#### Activity

- Enable RLS and Read for everyone policies to the movie rental tables (even just 1 or 2 will do for practice)
- Then recreate 2 of the queries from day 2 in postman

<h2>Connect Supabase to Nuxt</h2>

- [Use the Nuxt Supabase Module](https://supabase.nuxtjs.org/https://nuxt.com/modules/supabase)
- Steps:
  - install the module as a dev dependency
  - add it to your nuxt config in the modules list
  - create a .env file (project root)
    = Add your SUPABASE_URL and your SUPABASE_KEY
- The Supabase Nuxt Module is really a wrapper for the [supabase-js module](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/introduction)
  - under the hood it uses the same syntax and logc
  - [Review syntax here](https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/select)

<h2>Fetch Data from Supabase</h2>

- [Demo Repo](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/supabase/tree/main/demo)
  - review this source code for examples
- Sample request using the select statement

```js
const client = useSupabaseClient();
const { data } = await useAsyncData("film", async () => {
  const { data } = client.from("film").select("title", "description");
  return data;
});
```

### Activity (pair code): Render movie list

- Connect a nuxt install to your movie database using the Nuxt module instructions
- query a list of 10 movies from to a Nuxt API route
- pass the data to your app.vue file and render it with a v-for list
