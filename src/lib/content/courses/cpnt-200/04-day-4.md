### Monolithic CMS vs Headless CMS Stack Research (45 min - 1 hour)

- **Conduct a Quick Stack Tool Assessment**
- In groups of 3-4 take 20 minutes to research CMS solutions
  - Find 1 monolithic and 2-3 Headless options
  - Assess them for:
    - cost
    - integration options (ie: for Nuxt)
    - type of database used
    - number of users
    - bandwidth
    - other features that spark your interest
- Then take another 10 minutes to make a comparison of your 2 favourites
  - contrast them and identify:
    - your general preference
    - ideal use cases for each cms (one might be better for some kinds of site and less so for others)
    - features that needed more research to understand
    - most valuable features from your point of view
- Pros and Cons lists should be written down and sharable. Drop read only link to your notes in slack for your colleagues to learn from your research as well.

#### Class Debrief

- Each group will present on one of the CMS's reviewed
  - however, you'll speak to the CMS as individuals

<h2>Fetching Data From Supabase</h2>

### From Postman

- [Instructions](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/33919359904d6c8edcfa7461213b055a)
- To fetch from your data tables, you will need the api url and public anon key (find these in the settings)
- **Try practicing in small groups with a few queries as per the link**

<h2>Posting Data To Supabase</h2>

- With RLS policies off, you are able to add, update, and delete data
  - When you enable RLS, you'll need to also enable the access policies to do each CRUD operation
- Change the HTTP method from GET to POST
- Review the API docs in your supabase instance

  - this will show you how to make different types of requests. For Postman, work off of the bash syntax
  - It'll give you something like this that you need to parse:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST 'https://your-api-url-token.supabase.co/rest/v1/city' \
  -H "apikey: SUPABASE_KEY" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Prefer: return=minimal" \
  -d '{ "some_column": "someValue", "other_column": "otherValue" }'

  ```

- [Postman Instructions](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/create-requests/headers/)
- In postman, you'll need to set these headers up in the gui

  - apikey
  - Authorization
  - Content-Type
  - data
