<h2>Course Overview</h2>

This course is all about data. How it's stored, types of storage, how we access it, and how we manage it.

### Topics and Technologies

- SQL Databases (primary data structure focus) **database type**
  - postgresql
  - supabase
  - csv files
- NOSQL **database type**
  - document driven
  - Mongo DB
  - JSON files
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) **API Tool**
- Content Management Systems **Data Management Tool**
- [Directus](https://docs.directus.io/)
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) **Firebase Alternative**

<h2>Metaphors for Data</h2>

**google docs lists == nosql and google sheets == sql**

### Activity: Planning Data Structures 15 Minutes

**Objective**: Compare the two main ways that data is organized using common office tools.

1. Create a table in google sheets
   - Select pick a topic to make a table about (suggestions below)
   - library
   - users
   - game scores (sports or other)
2. create a document in google docs
   - Organize text content from a webpage into the document
   - Use google docs' headings to organize the content into sections
   - Use lists and sub headings to group as close to the actual website structure
3. recreate 1 level 2 heading worth of content from your doc file into a json file
   - ie the header for a page:
   ```json
   {
     "pageTitle": "Page Title",
     "pageDescription": "blah blah blah",
     "image": { "src": "/path/file.jpg", "alt": "description of image" },
     "callToAction": [{ "href": "https://url", "text": "Click me" }]
   }
   ```
4. Note 3 benefits and 3 potential problems of each way of organizing data

### Local Filetypes for Data

- csv (Comma Separated Values): A table filetype that is plain text and uses commas to organized columns and rows.
  - Can be used in javascript
  - emulates the kind of structure used in sql tables
  - [Svelte example](https://svelte.dev/repl/d41603e8668945dba79459575590261e?version=3.47.0)
  - _generally you won't have to import csvs into something like svelte, but you will import them into databases_
- json (Javascript Object Notation): A document key-value pair type of data structure.
  - This is the way that data is organized and passed from APIs
  - this document driven appraoch is how NOSQL databases like Mongo DB organize data

<h2>1. Introduction to Relational Databases</h2>

[![Slides - Relational DBs and SQL](/images/slides/cpnt-200/relational-db-sql.png)](/slides/cpnt-200/relational-db-sql)

### Materials

- [What is a Relational Database?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqjJjpjDRLc)
- Free Code Camp: [SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) - [2:36] - [What is a Database?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=156s) - [23:10] - [Tables & Keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=1390s)

### Mini Activity: Create a second table

- In the same google sheets file as last time, create another table
- It should relate to the first one (users - posts, categories - articles...)
- make sure it has an id and 1-2 other columns

<h2>2. Introduction to SQL</h2>

**There will be an open book SQL Syntax test on the last day of cpnt-200**

### Materials

- Free Code Camp: [SQL Tutorial - Full Database Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY) - [43:31] - [SQL Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=2611s)

### Syntax Notes

- [Free Code Camp Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-sql-commands/)
- [Harvard CS50 SQL Class](https://www.youtube.com/live/zrCLRC3Ci1c?si=xMchS-SSsAnVorwM): Advanced video lesson. Examples use python, but the concepts apply to javascript regarding queries as well.

### Activity: Practice making SQL Queries on SQLZoo

- [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
  - an online site to learn and practice sql
- Tasks:Practice Queries 0-6
- Write a query using syntax from one of the above activities but using **your** data set from google sheets

---

<h2> 3. Set up a database using CSV Files</h2>

### Materials

- [RPG Players](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fl8swPUfXc1rwv73wra7XqiZBGnHOmuQovDoJ1FtMF8/edit?usp=sharing)

### Instructions

1. Export each Google Sheet as a CSV file;
2. In Supabase, create each table by importing its respective CSV and: - _Enable_ RLS; - set `id` as primary; - set an appropriate data type (use `text` instead of `varchar`); - allow `NULL` as needed.
3. Add appropriate foreign keys for all one-to-many relationships;
4. Add a policy to each table that allows anyone to read the table.

<h2>Lab Activity</h2>

- Query Data from a public api of your choosing
  - find a public api that is interesting to you and easy(ish) to use
- Use Postman to query the data
  - query data 5 times, try to get more specific with each query
- Document your process and the queries that you used.
