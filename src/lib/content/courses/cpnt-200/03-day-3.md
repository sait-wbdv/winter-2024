<h2>Intro to Content Management</h2>

- We've been using locally hosted files in our websites for data. However this is not sustainable for many projects
  - issues:
    - you need to be a coder to be able to edit page data
    - page data isn't stored in a structured environment and requires editing template files to change things
    - Data in data.js type files requires going in and editing them
  - solutions:
    - host data in a database (as we've started to learn how to do)
    - set up a CMS that provides a user friendly way to edit, update, and access data
      - ie: Wordpress
- A CMS (content management system) is a way to solve these issues
- Popular CMS' include: Wordpress, Drupal, Strapi, Sanity...
- Traditionally CMS' like Wordpress bundles the actual data with the presentation through a theme

### Headless vs Monolithic CMS Architecture

- Video: [What's the point of a headless CMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uor3I0n_vQ)
- Traditional cms' are heavy and susceptible to attack, their plugin systems offer a lot of customizability but also introduce vulnerabilities, bloat, and pay walls
- Headless CMS', while taking more initial setup time offer:
  - lighter deployment
  - separation of data from presentation
  - added security
  - better developer experience
  - cheaper to run
  - more customizability
- However the drawbacks are:
  - the project will need a developer (this is good for us, and actually good for client even if they don't see it)
  - more setup time is required
  - more decisions need to be made at the beginning
  - initial setup time can be longer

### In Class Research

- In groups of 3-4 take 20 minutes to research CMS solutions
  - Find 1 monolithic and 2-3 Headless options
  - Assess them for:
    - cost
    - integration options (ie: for Nuxt)
    - type of database used
    - number of users
    - bandwidth
    - other features that spark your interest
- Then take another 10 minutes to make a comparison of your 2 favourites
  - contrast them and identify:
    - your general preference
    - ideal use cases for each cms (one might be better for some kinds of site and less so for others)
    - features that needed more research to understand
    - most valuable features from your point of view

#### Class Debrief

- Each group will present on one of the CMS's reviewed
  - however, you'll speak to the CMS as individuals

<h2>Our Stack: Supabase + Directus</h2>

- **[Supabase](https://supabase.com/): Database**
- **[Directus](https://directus.io/): Content Management Interface**
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com): Frontend
- [Render](https://render.com): Deployment
- [Github](https://github.com): Code Storage

### What does Directus do? and how are we using it

- Directus is an open source headless CMS
- Allows you rto build an interface for adding, deleting, modifying information in the database
- While it has it's own hosting, that costs money, so we are using it as an NPM project just like our website. **we configure it to connect to supabase**
  - benefits of this: it gives you the power and freedom of supabase, with the user friendly (especially for non devs) content editing experience

<h2>Demo: Set up and configure Directus+Supabase Locallly</h2>

- [Tutorial to hook the two up](https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/directus)

### Activity: Connect directus to Supabase

- using the deployed supabase project from last class
- set up directus as per the tutorial instructions
- run directus locally

#### A word about Environment Variables

- note the `.env` file in your directus directory
  - you never want `.env` to be pushed to your repo
  - `.env` environment variables are necessary for many things to run
    - but you don't want them to be visible to the outside world
- [adding environment variables in Render](https://docs.render.com/configure-environment-variables)
  - basically in your render, vercel etc, deployment; you need to recreate the environment from your local setup
    - as the `.env` file is not in the repo, you'll need to add those variables using Render's dashboard
      this workflow is more or less the same for all env variables and platforms.

#### Outcome

- The objective of doing this is to have a basis to compare again when we do a containerized cloud deployment next
- Instructions and resources provided will often give you examples like this
  - however we will need a more powerful deployment option

<h2>Explore the Directus Dashboard</h2>

### Content / Data Model

- Data Model collections are where you create schemas for data
  - set up the necessary fields for whatever your data is
    - common usages:
      - products
      - gallery
      - articles
      - posts
    - anything where you have the same data structure for repeated content
  - After setting up a data model, you can start creating content

### Activity: Create a blog post schema

- Create a blog post schema
- Fields should include:
  - title
  - summary
  - post
  - date
- For a more advanced experience, try recreating a post from [Cassie Codes](https://www.cassie.codes/)

<h2>Deploy Directus</h2>

- [Follow these instructions](https://gist.github.com/ashx3s/3ce0466cc19cbcb2ce600275cd8e8300)
- This will be the basis for your next assignment
