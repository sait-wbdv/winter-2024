<h2>SQL Query Warmups</h2>

Let's review what we worked on yesterday

- **Important SQL Syntax**
  - SELECT
  - FROM
  - COUNT
  - ORDER BY
- **Basic Syntax Pattern**

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM employees ORDER BY last_name DESC;
```

- **Multi Line Syntax Pattern**

```sql
SELECT
title, release_year
FROM film;
```

**WildCard Operator**

```sql
SELECT
COUNT(*)
FROM customers;

```

<h2>DISTINCT, LIMIT, AS</h2>

These are other methods that you can use to optimize your queries

### DISTINCT

**Your Tool for Finding Uniqueness**

- Purpose: Eliminates duplicate rows from your query results.
- Example: `SELECT DISTINCT product_category FROM products;`
- This returns a list of all unique product categories present in your 'products' table.
- Important: DISTINCT operates on the combination of all selected columns, not just individual ones.

#### **Challenge**

- A marketing team member has asked you about the different prices that need to be paid.
- Write a SQL query to get the different prices and order them from high to low

### LIMIT

**Control Your Output Size**

- Purpose: Restricts the number of rows returned by a query.
- Example: `SELECT FROM customers LIMIT 10;`
- Retrieves only the first 10 customer records.
- Helpful for: Testing queries, displaying results in pages, or getting a quick sample.

#### **Challenge**

- Create a single SQL query to retrieve 5 actors first and last names in descending order (starting with Z)

### AS

**The Nickname Giver**

- Purpose: Provides aliases (nicknames) for columns or calculated values in your query results. This makes - your output more readable and easier to work with.
- Example:

```sql
SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name;
SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price FROM products;
```

- Benefits:
  - Clarity: Improves column names (e.g., changing 'avg_price' to 'Average Price').
  - Conciseness: Creates shorter names for long expressions.
  - Necessity: Required when your calculation doesn't have a default name, like with aggregate functions.

#### **Challenge**

- Write a query that counts the number of customers with the last name smith. use AS to label the column as `number_of_smiths` or something to that effect
- **important**: note the casing, this might cause issues with your query, try using the string manipulator function in sql to convert it to lower case

<h2>Aggregator Functions</h2>

- COUNT(): Counts the number of rows.
- SUM(): Calculates the total of a numeric column.
- AVG(): Computes the average value of a numeric column.
- MIN(): Finds the minimum value in a column.
- MAX(): Finds the maximum value in a column.

### GROUP BY

- Use with GROUP BY: Aggregate functions often work in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to calculate summary statistics for different categories within your data.

Example: Calculating Average Order Value per Customer

```sql
SELECT
customer_id, AVG(order_total) AS average_order_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

---

<h2>Filtering with WHERE</h2>

**Your Data Filtering Workhorse**

Purpose: The WHERE clause lets you specify conditions that rows must meet to be included in the query results.
Syntax:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition(s);
```

### Common Filtering Patterns

#### Comparison Operators

- `=` (Equal to)
- `!=` or `<>` (Not equal to)
- (Greater than)
- `<` (Less than)
- `=` (Greater than or equal to)
- `<=` (Less than or equal to)
- Example: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'Canada';`
- Example: `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 20;`

#### **Challenges**

- filter a list of movies that are rated "PG"
- filter a list of movies that cost at most 2.99 to rent
- count all of the rentals that have not been returned yet (return_date is null)
- get a list of all the payment_ids with an amount less than or equal to $2. Include the payment_id and the amount

#### Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT)

- AND: Combines multiple conditions; both conditions must be true.
- OR: At least one condition must be true.
- NOT: Negates a condition.
- Example: `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2023-03-01' AND order_status = 'Shipped';`
- Example: `SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York' OR city = 'Los Angeles';`

#### **Challenges**

- filter a list of all the payments where the amount is less than 2 OR greater than 10
  - ordered by customer first (ascending)
  - then as a second order, order by amount

---

#### LIKE: Pattern Matching

- `%` (Wildcard): Matches zero or more characters.
- `_` (Underscore): Matches a single character.
- Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE 'Smart%';
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE email LIKE '%@gmail.com';
```

##### **Challenge**

- How many customers are there with a first name that is 3 letters long?
- How many have a 3 letter long first name and either an X or a Y as the last letter of the last name?

#### IN: Checking Membership in a List

- Example:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id IN (123, 456, 789);
```

### BETWEEN: Specifying a Range

- Example:

```SQL
SELECT \* FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 80000;
```

#### **Challenge**

- how many payments have been made on january 26 and 27 2020 with an amount between 1.99 and 3.99

<h2>Lab Activities</h2>

### Data Filtering

- Work on the challenges posted in LIKE, IN, and BETWEEN
- Revisit the first couple challenges and organize your code
- Submit the SQL Syntax to brightspace

### Work on your 262 group projects

- Work in your groups
  - **all teams need to do a standup session before their members can go for the day**
    - if people aren't in person, then go hybrid
- Talk to Ash if your group would like to do a meeting this week to review or discuss the project
