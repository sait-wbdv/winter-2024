## Scrum vs Kanban

### Scrum

- Watch video **[What is Scrum](https://youtu.be/b02ZkndLk1Y)**

### How scrum works?
- **[How does scrum work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js8qoCVuQko)** 

- Scrum is usually delivered in sprints. 

- A sprint is a time-boxed iteration during which the Scrum Team works to deliver a potentially shippable product increment. 

- Sprints are fixed-length periods of time, typically lasting between one to four weeks, with two weeks being the most common duration.

---

### Three roles of Scrum

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

---

### Scrum artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: It is a dynamic and prioritized list of all features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other deliverables that constitute the product.

- **Sprint Backlog**: Represents a subset of the Product Backlog selected for implementation during a specific sprint in Scrum.

- **Increment**: the sum of all the product backlog items (PBIs) completed during a sprint, integrated with all previously completed increments. It is the tangible result of the work done by the Scrum Team during a sprint.

### Scrum Events

- Sprint Planning

- Daily Scrum/Standup

- Sprint Review

- Sprint Retrospective

---

### Kanban

- Watch video **[What is Kanban](https://youtu.be/Bcid33tgq8A)**

- Its a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps software development. 

- It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. 

- Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

---

### How Kanban works

- Visualize the workflow
  - [Using Kanban boards](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards)

  - Work-in-progress limits: They specify the maximum number of items that can be in progress simultaneously within a particular stage of the development process.


- Continuous delivery using
  - Pull system

  - Minimizing cycle time: it represents the duration it takes for a work item to move through the entire workflow, from initiation to completion.

### kanban vs scrum

- scrum sprints have start and stop dates whereas kanban is an ongoing process

- Team roles are clearly defined in scrum (product owner, dev team, and scrum master), while kanban has no formal roles. Both teams are self-organized.

- A kanban board is used throughout the lifecycle of a project whereas a scrum board is cleared and recycled after each sprint

- A scrum board has a set number of tasks and strict deadline to complete them.

- Kanban boards are more flexible with regards to tasks and timing. Tasks can be re-prioritized, reassigned, or updated as needed.

### Project collaboration tools
 - Github Project

 - Asana

 - Trello

 - Jira

 - Clickup

 - Among many others
